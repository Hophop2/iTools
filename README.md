## Project Overview üéâ
<p style="text-align: justify;">This project I created by my curiosity about how works AI tools like image generator or chat. My main goals were to increase my skills in typescript, connections between client-server components, better and efficiently handling loading, error states than in my previous project - iTask. As I was going deeper into the project, I realized new things to learn or improve. The hardest part of this project were handling streaming Api responses and functionality of sending messages 
and how many different things can happen during this. This project caused a huge improve in my skills especially in what I mentioned above and give me idea for the next project that will be more challenging than iTools.</p>



**iTools** is a project involving authentication that relies on two AI-based tools. 

**AIReader** - allows you to upload PDF file by dropzone and after that chat with it to gain a specific information from your PDF. Files and messages are stored for every user. Chat uses a infinite message history on scroll.

**AImage** - generate a image according to your vision by your command, after that u can add photo to your invidual carousel collection or discard. Every saved image is stored and you can dowloand it
